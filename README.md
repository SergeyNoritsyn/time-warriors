Grade 12 Java Swing Final Project
This project involved developing a 2-player game using Java Swing libraries, implementing various object-oriented (OOP) building blocks and integrating them together
using a class hierarchy system, through inheritance. The 'src' folder contains all of the classes created for this project to function, one for each key object. The
'Resources' folder contains all of the text, visual, and sound files used to bring the game to life, including the weapons used by players and the various setting options.
